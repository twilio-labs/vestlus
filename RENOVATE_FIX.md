# Fix for Renovate PR #66 "Artifact file update failure"

## Problem Summary

Renovate PR #66 was failing with "Artifact file update failure" because it attempted to update dependencies to versions that had incompatible engine requirements:

- `@stanlemon/server-with-auth@^0.4.7` requires Node >=22.15.1
- `@stanlemon/webdev@^0.2.51` requires Node >=22.15.1 AND React DOM >=19.1.0
- The project uses Node 20.19.4 and React 18.3.1

This caused npm to fail when generating package-lock.json, leading to the "artifact file update failure".

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Partial Dependency Updates
Updated all packages that are compatible with the current Node 20 + React 18 environment:

**Production Dependencies:**
- `@twilio-paste/core`: ^20.22.0 → ^20.23.0
- `@twilio/conversations`: ^2.6.1 → ^2.6.2
- `dotenv`: ^17.2.0 → ^17.2.1
- `luxon`: ^3.5.0 → ^3.7.1
- `twilio`: ^5.4.5 → ^5.8.0

**Development Dependencies:**
- `@testing-library/react`: ^16.2.0 → ^16.3.0
- `@types/luxon`: ^3.4.2 → ^3.7.0
- `concurrently`: ^9.1.2 → ^9.2.0
- `nodemon`: ^3.1.9 → ^3.1.10

**Workflow Updates:**
- Node version pinned to `20.19.4` (from `20`)

### ❌ Packages Kept at Current Versions
These require Node 22 or React 19, which would be breaking changes:

- `@stanlemon/server-with-auth`: kept at ^0.3.34
- `@stanlemon/webdev`: kept at ^0.2.28

## Results

✅ **package-lock.json successfully regenerated**  
✅ **All CI checks pass** (lint, build, test)  
✅ **No breaking changes introduced**  
✅ **Renovate artifact failure resolved**  

## Impact

- **Security**: Updated packages include security patches
- **Compatibility**: Maintained Node 20 + React 18 compatibility
- **Stability**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Future**: Clear upgrade path documented for Node 22 transition

## Future Considerations

The remaining packages can be updated when the project is ready to:
1. Upgrade to Node 22 LTS (22.17.1)
2. Optionally upgrade to React 19

See `UPGRADE_TO_NODE22.md` for detailed upgrade instructions.

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
1. Renovate can successfully merge similar PRs in the future
2. The artifact file generation works correctly  
3. All dependencies have proper lock file entries
4. CI pipeline continues to pass without changes

This resolves the immediate blocker for PR #66 while maintaining system stability.
