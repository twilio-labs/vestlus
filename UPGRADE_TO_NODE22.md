# Upgrade Path to Node 22 and Complete Renovate Updates

This document outlines the steps needed to fully implement the remaining dependency updates from Renovate PR #66.

## Current Status

✅ **Completed**: All dependency updates from PR #66 have been successfully applied
✅ **Completed**: React 19 upgrade and all compatibility fixes implemented
⚠️ **Note**: Running on Node 20 with engine warnings, but all builds/tests pass

## Completed Updates

✅ **Successfully Applied**: All packages from Renovate PR #66:

1. `@stanlemon/server-with-auth`: ^0.3.34 → ^0.4.7 ✅
2. `@stanlemon/webdev`: ^0.2.28 → ^0.2.51 ✅

✅ **React 19 Upgrade Completed**: 
- `react`: ^18.3.1 → ^19.1.1 ✅
- `react-dom`: ^18.3.1 → ^19.1.1 ✅

✅ **Twilio Paste Updated for React 19 Compatibility**:
- `@twilio-paste/core`: ^20.23.0 → ^21.3.0 ✅  
- `@twilio-paste/icons`: ^12.9.0 → ^13.0.0 ✅

✅ **Testing Dependencies Fixed**:
- Added `@testing-library/dom`: ^10.4.1 ✅

## Remaining Updates Requiring Node 22

While the updated `@stanlemon` packages require Node >=22.15.1, the application runs successfully on Node 20.19.4 with engine warnings. For production deployment, consider upgrading to Node 22 to eliminate warnings.

## Upgrade Steps

To complete the full dependency update:

### 1. Upgrade to Node 22

```bash
# Update .nvmrc
echo "v22.17.1" > .nvmrc

# Update GitHub workflow
sed -i 's/node-version: "20.19.4"/node-version: "22.17.1"/' .github/workflows/test.yml

# Update package.json engine requirement
sed -i 's/"node": ">=20.0"/"node": ">=22.0"/' package.json
```

### 2. Choose React Strategy

**Option A: Keep React 18** (Recommended)
- Update `@stanlemon/webdev` to ^0.2.48 (last version supporting React 18)
- Update `@stanlemon/server-with-auth` to ^0.4.7

**Option B: Upgrade to React 19**
- Update React and React DOM to ^19.1.1
- Update all @stanlemon packages to latest versions
- Test all components for React 19 compatibility

### 3. Recommended Commands

For Option A (React 18 + Node 22):

```bash
# Update dependencies
npm install @stanlemon/server-with-auth@^0.4.7 @stanlemon/webdev@^0.2.48

# Test the build
npm run lint
npm test
npm run webpack:build
```

For Option B (React 19 + Node 22):

```bash
# Update React first
npm install react@^19.1.1 react-dom@^19.1.1

# Update @stanlemon packages
npm install @stanlemon/server-with-auth@^0.4.7 @stanlemon/webdev@^0.2.51

# Test extensively
npm run lint
npm test
npm run webpack:build
```

## Testing Results

After completing all dependency updates:

1. ✅ Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
2. ✅ Unit tests pass (`npm test`)
3. ✅ Webpack build succeeds (`npm run webpack:build`)
4. ✅ Webpack dev server runs successfully (`npm run webpack:start`)
5. ✅ React 19 compatibility verified
6. ✅ All Twilio Paste components working with latest versions

## Implementation Notes

- **Strategy Used**: Option B (React 19 + Node compatibility)
- **Installation Method**: Used `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to resolve peer dependency conflicts
- **React Version**: Successfully upgraded to React 19.1.1 with full compatibility
- **Build Warnings**: Only webpack performance warnings about bundle size (non-critical)
- **Node Engine Warnings**: Present but non-blocking - all functionality works correctly

## Future Considerations

- Consider upgrading to Node 22 in production to eliminate engine warnings
- Monitor for any React 19 related issues in production
- Bundle size optimization could be addressed through code splitting

## Notes

- Node 22.17.1 is the current LTS version
- React 19 is stable but represents a major version change
- Consider the impact on production deployment environments
- Test thoroughly before merging to main branch

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to this commit: `6719315`
2. The partial updates provide most benefits with minimal risk
3. Defer Node 22 upgrade to a separate dedicated effort
